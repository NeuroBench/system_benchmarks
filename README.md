# NeuroBench System Benchmark Rules

Many of the rules are used from MLPerf Inference, Mobile, and Tiny.

### Benchmarks

Two benchmarks are included, acoustic scene classification (ASC) and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization for solving max-independent set (QUBO-MIS). The former targets edge devices while the latter targets cloud-scale computing.
